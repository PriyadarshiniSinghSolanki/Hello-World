/*Name and marks in different subjects (physics, chemistry and maths) are given for all students.
 * The task is to compute total marks and ranks of all students. And finally display all students sorted by rank.
 *
 * Rank of student is computed using below rules.
 * If total marks are different, then students with higher marks gets better rank.
 * If total marks are same, then students with higher marks in Maths gets better rank.
 * If total marks are same and marks in Maths are also same, then students with better marks in Physics gets better rank.
 * If all marks (total, Maths, Physics and Chemistry) are same, then any student can be assigned bedtter rank.*/
