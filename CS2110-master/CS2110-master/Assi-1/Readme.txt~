Program 1 - prob-1-truth-table.c
Date : 14 - 08 - 2010

* How to build the program -
  gcc prob-1-truth-table.c

  Execute -
  ./a.out

Program 2 - prob-2-tautology.c
Date : 14 - 08 - 2010

* How to build the program -
  gcc prob-2-tautology.c

  Execute -
  ./a.out

* Algorithms used

 * Convert given Infix expression to Postfix - 
   Shunting Yard Algorithm
 * Evaluate a given Postfix expression for a given set of values
   Postfix Algorithm

* Issue(s) faced
  * Separating the common functions between the two programs into a single file
    [Note - for submission purposes, the common functions have been pasted
    	    into the individual files]

* Testing of code
  1. With arbitrary characters, which should raise error
  2. With mismatched parentheses
  3. With too few tokens
  4. With too few variables given
  5. With different alphabets as variable names
  6. With spaces
  7. With postfix expressions (which should not be accepted)
  8. With correct Infix expressions, but without parentheses
     to test whether precedence of operators is being checked for
