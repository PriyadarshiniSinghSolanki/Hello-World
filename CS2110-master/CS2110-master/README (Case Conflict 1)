Date : 19 - 09 - 2010

* How to build the program -
  g++ load-file-and-search.cpp

  Execute -
  ./a.out

* Algorithms used
  * Basic Linear Search

* Issue(s) faced
  * Different approaches lead to vastly different running times
  * For example, Sorting of 10^6 records took 7 seconds
  * Linear Search was much quicker as the time taken for user to
    enter key would be greater than time to search

* Testing of code
  1. With non-existent file name
  2. With non-numeric 
  3. With too few tokens
  4. With too few variables given
  5. With different alphabets as variable names
  6. With spaces
  7. With postfix expressions (which should not be accepted)
  8. With correct Infix expressions, but without parentheses
     to test whether precedence of operators is being checked for
  9. With above as command line arguments

* References
 * Convert given Infix expression to Postfix -
