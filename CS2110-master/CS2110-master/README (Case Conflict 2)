Date : 19 - 09 - 2010

* How to build the program -
  g++ load-file-and-search.cpp

  Execute -
  ./a.out

* Algorithms used
  * Basic Linear Search

* Issue(s) faced
  * Different approaches lead to vastly different running times
  * For example, Sorting of 10^6 records took 7 seconds
  * Linear Search was much quicker as the time taken for user to
    enter key would be greater than time to search

* Testing of code
  1. With non-existent file name
  2. With non-numeric or non-positive value for n
  3. With too few or too many cmd-line arguments
  4. With too few records in a file
  5. With newlines in the middle of fields (Accepted as part of field)
